/**
 * OPERATORS:
 * 
 * 0: JavaScript Operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations and 
 * variables. They are the building blocks of JavaScript expressions and can 
 * manipulate data in various ways.
 * 
 * 1) Assignment Operators
 *      Assignment Operators assign values to JavaScript variables. They can 
 * also perform basic operations such as addition or multiplication while 
 * assigning the values.
 * 
 * General Assignment Operators:
 * 
 *      Simple Assignment, written with a single = sign
 *          ~   The simple assignment assigns a simple value to a variable.
 *          ~   This can also be used to assign value to a string.
 * 
 *      Addition Assignment, written with a + and an = sign
 *          ~   The addition assignment adds value to a variable.
 *          ~   This can also be used to assign value to a string.
 * 
 *      Subtraction Assignment, written with a - and an = sign
 *          ~   The subtraction assignment removes value from a variable.
 * 
 *      Multiplication Assignment, written with a * and an = sign
 *          ~   The multiplication assignment multiplies a variable.
 * 
 *      Exponentation Assignment, written with two ** and an = sign
 *          ~   The expoonentation assignment  raises a variable.
 *          to the power of the operand.
 * 
 *      Division Assignment, written with a / and an = sign
 *          ~   The division operator divides a variable.
 * 
 *      Remainder Assigment Operator, written with a % and an = sign
 *          ~   The remainder Operator assigns a remainder to a variable.
 * 
 *  Logical Assignment Operators:
 * 
 *      Logical AND Assignment Operator, written with two && an = sign
 *          ~   The logical AND assignment operator is used between 2 values.
 *          ~   If the first value is true, the second value is assigned.
 * 
 *      Logical OR Assignment Operator, written with two || and an = sign
 *          ~   The logical OR assignment operator is used between 2 values.
 *          ~   If the first value is false, the second value is assigned.
 *
 *      Nullish Coalescing Assignment Operator, written with two ?? and an = sign
 *          ~   The nullish coalescng assignment operator is used between 2 values.
 *          ~   If the first value is undefined or null, the second value
 *              is assigned.
 * 
 * ((Bonus Weird not really an operator:
 *      Object Property Syntax, written with a : inbetween an object's keys and values ))
 *      
 * 2) Arithmetic Operators
 *      Arithmetic Operators perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables). They 
 * take numerical values (or strings) as their operands and return a single numerical 
 * value (or string).
 * 
 *      Addition, written with a + sign
 *          ~   The addition assignment adds numbers.
 *          ~   This can also be used to concatenate strings together.
 * 
 *      Subtraction, written with a - sign
 *          ~   The subtraction assignment subtracts numbers.
 * 
 *      Multiplication, written with a * sign
 *          ~   The multiplication assignment multiplies numbers.
 * 
 *      Division, written with a / 
 *          ~   The division operator divides numbers.
 * 
 *      Remainder, written with a % sign, or modulus
 *          ~   The modulus operator returns the division remainder.
 * 
 *      The Increment Operator, written with two ++ signs
 *          ~   The increment operator increments numbers.
 * 
 *      The Decrement Operator, written with two -- signs
 *          ~   The decrement operator decrements numbers
 * 
 *      The Exponentation Operator, written with two ** signs
 *          ~   The exponentation operator raises the first operand 
 *              to the power of the second
 * 
 * ((Bonus Operator Precendence:
 *      Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an 
 * arithmetic expression. As in traditional school mathematics, Multiplication (*) and division (/) 
 * have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-). And (as in school mathematics) 
 * the precedence can be changed by using parentheses. When using parentheses, the operations 
 * inside the parentheses are computed first:))
 * 
 * 3) Comparison Operators
 * 
 * 4) Logical Operators
 * 
 * 5) Unary Operators (!, typeOf, -)
 * 
 * 6) Ternary Operators (a ? b : )
