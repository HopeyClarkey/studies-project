/**
 * CONTROL FLOW:
 * 
 * 0: Conditional statements allow us to control the flow of our application.
 * we can make decisions in our code by asking true or false questions. Based
 * on the answer we decide what code runs if the question is true, and what
 * code runs if the question is false. To do this, we use condtional statements
 * These are if-statements and their chains, if-elseif-else. We can also use 
 * switch statements similarly to control flow.
 * 
 * In javascript, condtional statements boil down to comparisons and or values 
 * based on their truthy-ness or falsey-ness. Values will be coerced to-(changed)
 * into boolean, this means the value is evaluated in a boolean context.
 * 
 * 1) If
 * 
 * 2) Else-If
 * 
 * 3) Else
 * 
 * 4) Switch
