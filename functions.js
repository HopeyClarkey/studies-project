/**
 * FUNCTIONS:
 * 
 * 0: Functions are a fundemental building block of Javascript. A function in javascript is 
 * similar to a procedure- a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value,
 * but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an
 * output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To
 * use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it
 * 
 *  1) The two phases to using functions: First we must define the function by giving it a name 
 *     Next we can execute, invoke, or call a function by using that name.
 * 
 *  2) Parameters refer to the variables listed in a function's declaration, defining the 
 *  input that the function can accept. Arguments, however, are the actual values passed to 
 *  the function when it is called, filling the parameters during execution.
 * 
 *  3) A named function can be created like this :
 *          function nameOfFunction (){
 *              body of function
 *          }
 * 
 *  4) How to assign a function to a variable:
 *          let nameOfFunctionToo = function(){
 *          }
 * 
 *  5) Functions take inputs, and return a single value. Inputs are specified as parameters
 *  when writing the function, and outputs are defined by the 'return' statement.
 * 
 *  6) Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes. 
 *  The inverse is NOT true.
 * 
 *  7) closures: Functions form closures areound the data they house. If an object returned 
 *  from the Function and is held in memory somewhere (referenced), that closure stays ALIVE,
 *  and data can continue to exist in these closures.
