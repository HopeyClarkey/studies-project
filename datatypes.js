/**
 * DATATYPES:
 * 
 * 0: Javascript has several major categories to describe a value's type:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 1)                               Number: 
 *    simple/primitive datatype, represents a numeric value or integer.
 * 
 * 2)                               String:
 *       simple/primitive datatype, represents a string of characters,
 *                          commonly used for text.
 * 
 * 3)                               Boolean: 
 *          simple/primitive datatype, represents a true/false value.
 * 
 * 4)                                Array: 
 *      complex datatype, represents a list of data, contained within a [].
 * 
 * 5)                                Object: 
 *                 complex datatype, represents a group of data 
 *                        subgrouped by keys & values
 * 
 * 6)                               Function:
 *                 complex datatype, represents any number of 
 *                      statements that work with data.
 * 
 * 7)                              Undefined:
 *               simple/primitive datatype- it exists, but has no value
 * 
 * 8)                                 Null:
 *                          simple/primitive datatype, no data at all.
 * 
 * 9) NaN - simple/primitive datatype
 * 
 * 10) Infinity and -Infinity
 * 
 * 11) Difference betweeen primitive/simple and complex datatypes
 *                         Simple datatypes: 
 *    Are immutable, they do not hold, collect, or aggregate other values, 
 *    and operations on simple datatypes return simple values, they do not 
 *    alter the original value. 

 * 
 *                             Complex datatypes:
 *    Are mutable, the aggregate other values and therefore are of indefinate 
 *    size. Objects can contain any number of key:value pairs. Arrays can 
 *    have any number of elements. Functions can have any number of statements.
 * 
 * 12) Primitive values are passed to a function BY COPY, 
 * and complex value types BY REFERENCE. 
 * 
 *    Simple value types are 'copy-by-value'- when assigning or passing, 
 *    simple data-types are copied from one variable to the next. Variables 
 *    can only directly contain simple types, because the maximum amount of 
 *    memory a simple datatype is is 8 bites, which is the amount
 *    each variable takes up in memory.
 * 
 *    Complex datatypes are 'copy-by-reference'- when assigning or passing, 
 *    complex data-types are passed by reference to the data.
